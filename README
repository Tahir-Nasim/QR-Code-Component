## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties



### What I learned

Learned about customizing the container and body according to the screen width and alignment of elements as well as embedding the external fonts from google fonts to the main styles file.


### Continued development

I'll be focussing on the mobile/responsive view of the web pages as i've just learnt basic HTML and CSS in desktop perspective.
